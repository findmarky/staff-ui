# Users and Roles

A small React JS project with the goal of building something close to the real-world and cover alot of features in React.

The user data is provided by [Random User Generator](https://randomuser.me/)

The MapBox API requires an access token which you can get by signing up to [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Next set the access token in `UserLocationMap.tsx` 

E.g. `mapboxgl.accessToken = '<API KEY>'`
